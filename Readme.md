From Nitwit to Gitwit course repo

Note that lesson 1-3 (for now) were made using Marp. However there seem to be some serious limitations with marp (i.e. no support for mermaid, suggestion solution is to have mermaid render to SVG and then have that in your source file)

So lesson 4- are.... reveal.

Open by starting local webserver and open reveal-js.html?slide-dir=X where X is lesson number.

In chrome, append `&print-pdf` to the `search` to print to PDFs
