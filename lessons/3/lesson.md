# Homework take-aways

`cat test.txt` will print the content of `test.txt` to the screen.

However if you do `cat` by itself, you seem to be "stuck".

Things to try: CTRL-C (break), CTRL-\ (really break), CTRL-D (exit).

Sometimes CTRL-D on newline.

However, don't press it twice, or you'll exit your shell ;)

# Lesson 3

- Numeral systems: binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal
- CLI commands: pipe, redirect, how programs fit together (& terminal)
- Diff and Patch

## Numeral systems

If you thought that at least numbers were something you could count on being simple....

**You're wrong!!**

vvvvvv

## Numeral systems

- Decimal (base 10)
- Binary (base 2)
- Octal (base 8)
- Hexadecimal (base 16)
- Base 64
- Base 256


---

## Decimal (base 10):


<foobar>
$$
\begin{aligned}
42 &= 4 * 10 + 2 * 1 \\
42 &= 4 * 10^1 + 2 * 10 ^0 \\
123450 &= 1 * 10^5 + 2 * 10 ^ 4 + 3 * 10^3 * 4 * 10 ^ 2 + 5 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^0 \\
& \\
3.14 &= 3 * 10^0 + 1 * 10^{-1} + 4 * 10^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$
</foobar>

---

## Binary (base 2)


Written as `0b.....`

<foobar>
$$
\begin{aligned}
 0\mathrm{b}10 &= 1 * 2^1 + 0 * 2 ^ 0 = 2 \\
 0\mathrm{b}101010 &= ...
\end{aligned}
$$
</foobar>

A single 1 or 0 is called a bit. 8 bits is a byte:

<foobar>
$$
\begin{aligned}
 0\mathrm{b}00000000 &= 0 \\
 0\mathrm{b}11111111 &= 255
\end{aligned}
$$
</foobar>

_There are 10 types of people in the world: those who understand binary, and those who don't._

vvvvvv

## Endianness

![byte](3/byte.webp)

Please decode what byte is in the signal above

---

## Hexadecimal (hex; base 16)

Written as `0x.....`
We need characters for the numbers 10-15: `A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15`.
Both uppercase and lowercase used

<foobar>
$$
\begin{aligned}
 0\mathrm{x}10 &= 16 \\
 0\mathrm{xFF} &= ... \\
 0\mathrm{xdeadbeef} &= ... \\
\end{aligned}
$$
</foobar>

Two hex-digits are one byte (16 * 16 = 256)

---
(lesser systems)

## Octal (base 8)

Written as `0o.....` or `0....`

Only used in specific contexts

## Base 64

Uses symbols `0-9a-zA-Z` (10 + 26 + 26 = 62) and two extra (often `+` and `\`).

Used to display binary data in "printable symbols"

vvvvvv

### Side note: other non-computer bases

- Base 10 comes from "counting on one's fingers"
- Base 12  (duodecimal) minor and speculative usage, foot-inch, dozen-gross, months in year, 12 hours in a day (and 12 in a night).
- Base 20 (vigesimal) Mayans, some early European systems
- Base 60 (sexagesimal) used by Babylonians and still in use for time-keeping / angular positioning:

<foobar>
$$
\begin{aligned}
 5\mathrm{h}30\mathrm{m}12\mathrm{s} &= 5 * 60^2 + 30 * 60^1 + 12 * 60 ^ 0 \mathrm{s} \\
 77^{\circ} 00\mathrm{`} 06`` &= 77 * 60 ^ 0 + 0 * 60 ^{-1} + 6 * 60^{-2} = 77.0013^{\circ} \\
 15^{\circ} 32` 28`` &= 15 * 60 ^ 0 + 32 * 60 ^{-1} + 28 * 60^{-2} = 15.54410^{\circ} \\
\end{aligned}
$$
</foobar>

UK until 1971: 4 farthing = 1 penny, 12 pence = 1 shilling, 20 shilling = Â£1

Note that base 12 and base 60 nice for mathematical reasons.

# CLI programs


```asciiart
           command line parameters
                      |
                      |
                      V
                  *-------*
     (stdin --->) |PROGRAM|----> stdout
                  |       |----> stderr
                  *-------*
                      |
                      |
                      V
                return code
```

# The terminal

All connections between programs (incl shell) are binary: `0100101110100101010101...`

The terminal (traditionally) transforms it into "characters" and then "pixels"

```asciiart
                    A
                    S         F
                    C         O    ....1....
                    I         N    ...1.1...
                    I         T    ..1...1..
01000001 ----> 65 ----> 'A' ---->  .1.....1.
                                   111111111
                                   1.......1
                                   1.......1
```

And in the other direction (when a key is pressed, sends the ASCII code as binary "on the wire").

# Some commands
These commands all work on stdin, but can also take a filename (or multiple)

`cat` -- print content
`tr abc def` -- replace every `a` with `d`, every `b` with `e`, etc.
`wc -l` -- count lines
`wc -c` -- count characters
`grep Raven` -- only show lines with the word "Raven"
`grep -v Raven` -- only show lines without the word "Raven"
`grep -n Raven` -- `-n` adds line numbers
`head -n 10` / `tail -n 10` -- show first / last 10 lines
`cut -d ' ' -f 2-3` -- show words 2 and 3 for each line
`|` is the command to connect the `stdout` of one program to the `stdin` of the next

e.g. `cat test.txt | grep hello | tr he ba`

# Play time

Each has their own environment.

In the directory `~/raven` there are 3 different versions of the poem by E.A.Poe.
For now we focus on `original.txt`.

- Print the poem
- How many lines does it have?
- Print only the lines with `raven`.
  Is this what you expected?
- How many lines are there without an `a` in them.
- Print the lines with both `bird` and `fancy` in them
- Now the same, but only the first line
- Now the same, but with line numbers
- Can you make the poem about a Bever?

# Diff and patch (the workhorses of git)

- `diff file1 file2` shows the difference between 2 files
- `diff -u file1 file2` shows the difference between 2 files in better format
- `patch orginal patchfile -o -` applies the patchfile (result of diff) to original

---

# Playtime 2

- look at the differences between `modern.txt` and each of `modern?.txt`
- make a patchfile for `modern.txt` to `modern2.txt` (how can we write `stdout` to a file? See lesson 1)
- apply this to `modern3.txt`. Save the result in `modern23.txt`.
- now add the changes of `modern4.txt` to it `modern234.txt`
- now make `modern2345.txt`. Did it work? Why not?
