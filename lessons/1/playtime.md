# Play time

- Make sure we are in the `/tmp` directory
- Now make a directory "project"
- Go to directory "project"
- Make a directory "A"
- Make a file "test.txt" in this new directory with content "hello everyone"
- Print the contents of this file to the console

---

- Make a directory B next to directory A
- In this directory make a file "manyhellos.txt", containing 10 lines with the word "hello"
- Now print (to the console) in 1 command the contents of both `~/project/A/test.txt` and `~/project/B/manyhellos.txt`

---

- Copy `test.txt` to the `B` directory
- Rename the `test.txt` file to `onehello.txt`
- Delete `onehello.txt`
- Now, in one command, copy `test.txt` to the `B` directory with name `onehello.txt`
- List all files in the `B` directory
- Print the content of both files

---

- Try to remove the `A` directory
- Remove the files in the `A` directory and remove it

- Print the working directory and store it in `~/projects/mydir.txt`
- Print the working directory twice and store it in `~/projects/mydirs.txt`
