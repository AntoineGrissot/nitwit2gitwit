title: About the course
---

This website contains the slides and the homework assignments for the From Nitwit To Gitwit course, that was first given in 2023.
These pages are a living document; they will be updated and adjusted each year.

The goal of the course is to give people who work with computers and code, but are not developers, an idea of what `git` is, why one would want to use the shell, and why GitHub may or may not be interesting to use in one's workflow.
An explicit goal is that the students actually understand _why_ of their actions, not just the _how_.

The course takes about 10 weeks, with a 1.5 hour lecture each week, and 1 hour homework.

In case there is any interest by others to adopt this course, please reach out on nitwit2gitwit@claude.nl.
